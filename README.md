Investigating linguistic features of Anorexia and Bulimia Nervosa in Italian online forums through NLP techniques

The aim of this thesis is to investigate linguistic features characterizing individuals with eating
disorders (EDs) by employing Natural Language Processing (NLP) methodologies. Given the
limited research in the field, particularly on EDs other than Anorexia Nervosa (AN) and in
languages other than English, this study specifically focuses on written productions in Italian of two
different subgroups of EDs: Anorexia Nervosa and Bulimia Nervosa (BN). Data were collected
from online forums and a third group was included as a control. By adopting a multidisciplinary
approach, the research integrates NLP techniques and tools, such as Sentiment Analysis, Emotion
Detection, Topic Modelling, and Frame Semantic Parsing, with a variety of descriptive statistics and
the LIWC analysis tool. While further research is needed for a deeper understanding of linguistic
markers specific to each ED, preliminary findings reveal distinct patterns in language use across the
three groups, highlighting variations in emotional expression, linguistic density, and topic framing.
